SM control of Portal-spawning 
    - Portals should have a non-forced action for each unit type it can spawn
    - + an action to set Ammo
    - Idle script triggers actions to a pre-set build schedule based on Energy 
        and Ammo
    - New objective: Spawn_Class
        Portal spawns a unit of Objective-Parameter class
    - New objective: Release_Recent
        Portal releases the most recently created unit
    - SM keeps track of Portals in a couple of Achronal Fields
    - SM can order Portals to produce specific units based on game-state information 
        using Spawn_Class objective dispatching
    - SM can order Portals to release specific units with Release_Recent dispatching


Echo HM - Horde Mode
    - A deck drawing, wave survival, RPG game mode
    - Played on a 6:00 timeline with slow timewaves 
    - Players start at a fixed location with only a scout spawner of their 
        chosen species
    - On-map resource crates are extremely limited
    - Enemy attack waves periodically spawn from random directions
        - 1 wave every 4 minutes
        - Attack waves aggressively A-move at 1. RPs 2. IPs 3. High HP units
    - Players can capture Ingress Portals (IPs)
        - IPs function as normal Tporters 
        - Can be captured like Amplifiers
        - Periodically can be ordered to spawn a randomly selected unit/
            squad/tech from one of several draw pools, at a very low resource
            cost
        - To prevent retcon spamming, IP production has a long time delay 
            (2 minutes)
    - Players can attack fixed-location creep mobs/bases to secure more 
        resource crates and IPs, or to do quests
    - NPC units/factions give quests that reward units and resources


Echo SM AI redesign 3
    - Spawner Portals create CARRIED units. 
    - Stable attack 1:
        When the SM wants fresh units to attack it will order a Portal
        (stored in an AF) to dispatch its cargo to an A-move destination
        (also stored in an AF) in a specific time-point and metatime-range.
        (For fairness this should mostly be for present-ward use.)
    - Stable attack 2:
        SM queries a specific unit for an A-move order at a specific time-metatime
        and stores it in an AF for subsequent dispatch at the same time-point.
        (Generally you want to use chunky boys for this.)
    - Stable attack 3:
        SM queries all AI units of a type within a region and gives them an A-move
        order (destination computed from immutable parameters or stored in an AF). 
        This should be reserved for young units, simulating queued orders.
    - New scripts:
        portal_idle - release units locally if under attack (a few at first, more if
            heavily damaged), release all ASAP if time is less than 3:00
        portal_dispatch - release carried units with A-move orders in descending HP order
        portal_teleport - if there is a visible teleporter in range, release carried units
            like portal_dispatch, except with teleport orders. Otherwise switch to the 
            standard portal_dispatch script.

Monk's Echo Notes:
*******************************
> New start is bad and too long (5-10s dead time would be better)
> Arcticus energy mechanic is arbitrary
    Boost Arcticus starting Energy to 150/225
    Change Ligo cost to 150 E, remove sacrifice mechanic
    Increase Ligo build time to 30-40 s
> Boost CE to 8 orders and 0.25 regen
> Boost Titanomachy pathing strength or replace the rocks with a turret

> Wants to know non-micro Oligo counters
> Me: 5 opod rush would have worked if Monk had skipped 2 Opods over the choke

* Cloak domes are too strong (and scary) (but they are ok in a rush situation...)
    - Reduce AA (& AG) Atk strength
    > or give Spods more vis + atk range
* Amp victory vs a turtle opponent is too hard
    - Add Amp spawning
    > or reduce number of VPs needed / add more amps
    > For Titano a good victory threshold is "all amps but 2"
* Spawner Portals are too hard to micro around and to kill
    - Reduce their HP and give them a TSS
X Wreckage causes lots of butterflies and fiddly micro
    - Remove or reduces wreck damage and/or lifespan
* Doesn't like random dieing at red HP
    - Suggests changing to die if red HP AND under attack
    - Suggests Opod should protect itself more
* Reverting LC to QP is annoying
    - (No action)
* Opods very strong
    - Reduce regen speed (same ppod?)
    - or reduce speed
        + reduce Pharo skip cost 
* Guardian (and base class) needs a way to hurt other guardians 
    - Tone down their HP regen
    - or block regen when LAD is set
* Dome can't hurt progenitors! WTF
* Titanomachy derelict turret placement is weird and the MFabs cause pathing problems
    - increase pathing str and make the script kill the MFabs
* Vanguard tech progen tooltip info is confusing
* Opod progen tool tip is weird (vecgir!)
* Need notification for enemy-surrender victory
* Landers should not be able to attack after cloaking
* Current Lander meta is to have every lander run and spawn without ever stopping (for fear of getting sniped). That leads to AI contenders every game.


Crazy plan (new):
X0. Remove AMP freeze, INSTEAD capturing an AMP should knock it out for 2-3 minutes
*1. Buff Pharo ->
    *- add 5s TSS death rattle
    *- maybe remove storming shield   
    - Transformations should clear TSS
*2. Change Opod -> replace fast regen with death buffer
    *- Max Energy -> 40
    *- explosion requires 0 Energy
    *- every 9 ticks, if ammo is full && HP <= 120 && HP > 0, set HP to 120 and consume 1 E
    - maybe, make Opod detect cloaked buildings 
*3. Nerf Ppod -> 6 sq/s move speed
    *- replace regen with 16s shield reset
*4. Nerf Dome -> 330 HP, ++ atk rate, -- atk str
    *- Reduce cost: 100 QP
    X- Reduce cost: 100 QP, 200 P, 20 E. Same mechanic as Reaphs. (200 P to morph)
*5. Replace Guardian HP regen
_6. Buff Sepipods! 3X ATK vs all (2X vs all currently)
7. Thematic Consistency: 
    *- Pligo morph mechanic requires Gate tech
    *- Freeze beam should not be able to target TSSed stuff
    *- Sligo should not have HP regen, in keeping with other Sepi line units
    X- Reduce Sligo cost to 400 
    X- 2X Cuttle death rattle
8. Buff up early eco
    - Remove invisible Keeper resource gen
    - add Assimilate ability to Keepers:
        Consume up to A/15 cores from any red crates in range for an immediate 
        +30 QP, +30 Power per core
        Costs min 120/240 Ammo (consumes 15 A/core), starts at 60 A, +1 A/s
    

Crazy plan (old):
x1. Opod -> Detector, 2 sq/s move speed
*2. Dome -> 330 HP, ++ atk rate, -- atk str 
x3. Pharo skip cost -> 40 P
x4. Ppod -> 4.5 sq/s move speed
5. Landers:
    *- New ability: Interdict - self-destruct the Lander
    - New ability: Pass Control - change unit owner to match a targeted ALLY unit 
    - T +0.00 to T +0.20
            - Landers can move and/or self-destruct only (cannot attack or claim a base)
            - AI Landers are Nanite controlled by the closest human ENEMY
    - T +0.20 to T +2.00
            - unlock ability to (infect?), claim bases, pass control, cloak, and attack
            - Change AI Landers Nanite control by the closest human ALLY
            - Self destruct at end of time
            

Crazy Anti-rush plan (new):
*1. Nerf AMP freeze
    *Increase AMP freeze beam cost 100 QP -> 100 QP, 500 P
    *Require full control
    *Decrease anti-freeze cost to 150 QP
*2. Buff Reaphs:
    *Decrease Reaph spawning cost: 200 P -> 100 P
    *+ Give them auto-recover
    *reduce starting P to 800
*3. reduce Octo RP cost from 200 P -> 0 P   
*4. Reduce max CE to 6 orders
5. Rename grekim techs to letters (B,C,D,L,S) 
_6. Change AMP resource generation to an active ability
*7. Resource Buffering:
    400 QP: 
        *Sepi 2x gnd atk 
        *RP + Dome cloaking
    
    800 P: 
        XReaph full efficiency
        *Non triad G Energy regen
    400 P: 
        XG passive special abilities
        XReaph healng
        *G passive HP regen
        CESO Cloaking
      0 P: 
        *Grekim t/cport limit
        *RP QP cutoff
        
    *RP QP limit -> 1600 QP
    *RP power limit: +800 P
    *Triad autoproduction: +400 QP
    
    *Starting resources: +400 QP
            
            
Monk talking points:
*******************************
* Stuff you wanted
    Amps can spawn more amps
    Spod attack increased by 3X
    Rapid HP regen nerfed
* Stuff to test
    Does decreasing max CE from 12 -> 6 orders help the match pacing?
    Does the new Landers lead to a better nash equilibrium?
        Is there anything I should do in the UI to improve understanding of the landers?
    Does the increased cost of AMP freeze and the more generous starting resources 
        sufficiently defang the freeze rush?
    Are Grekim's resource banking incentives beneficial?
    Is quadopod op?
            

*******************************
New Starting sequence:
*******************************
0 s     
    * Players start at fixed neutral starting positions (e.g. drop pods)
        with only a Species Selector, and a Landing Beacon (LB)
    * LB has no attack, moderate HP and vision; moves 9 sq/s
    * LB can immediately spawn a scouting-unit set from any of the 3 species
        * A full set is worth 800 QP (80 E)
        * Grekim scouts: Octo (10 E, max 8), Sepi (10 E, max 8), Opod (40 E, max 2), 
            Spod (40 E, max 2)
        * Human scouts: Marine (5 E, max 16), SOP (10 E, max 8), ATHC (20 E, max 4), 
            Lancer (20 E, max 4)
        * Vecgir scouts: T Pulser (20 E, max 4), Z Tercher (60 E, max 1)
    * LB can grab and release friendly units from anywhere on the map to their 
        current location; 4s cooldown each time
    * Species Selector may be pre-set with species choice orders
2 s
    * AI controlled Species Selectors get Nanited to the nearest ENEMY human player
    - "Insertion teleport-link secured." 
    - "Select drop points while awaiting Teleporter Lock for Achron transit"
12 s
    * AI controlled Species Selectors and RTBs get Nanited to the nearest ALLY human player
25 s
    * Species Selector starts producing starter units of the selected species
    - "Teleporter Lock: select operation assets"
1:25 
    * RTBs expire
    - "Contact lost with insertion teleporter"
    - G: "Commence opperation"
    - H: "Good hunting, Achron-Commander"
